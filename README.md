Allino

The Allino is nostr stack (relay/blossom mediaserver/nip-05 server) which is manageable (using nip-86) and [plugin-able](./docs/plugins.md). We designed it for self-hosting and backups.

This project is based on [Khatru](add-link), [EventStore](add-link), [BlobStore](add-link) and [go-nostr](add-link).

## How to run?

> TODO.


## Use cases

This project is highly suitable for personal, community, team and backup usage since its light-weight, feature-full and easy to setup/manage.

If you are aiming to run a relay/nip-05 server/blossom media server for large scale and high load (as a paid relay, default relay fo your client or a public global relay) you can consider using the [Immortal](add-link) relay and its adjacent projects.

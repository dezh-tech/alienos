## Use cases

This project is highly suitable for personal, community, team and backup usage since its light-weight, feature-full and easy to setup/manage.

If you are aiming to run a relay/nip-05 server/blossom media server for large scale and high load (as a paid relay, default relay fo your client or a public global relay) you can consider using the [Immortal](https://github.com/dezh-tech/immortal) relay and its adjacent projects.

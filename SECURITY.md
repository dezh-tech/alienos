# Security Policy

This is a full guide for reporting and behaving with security vulnerabilities in this project.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find any security vulnerability in this project, you can send a full report to [security@dezh.tech](mailto:security@dezh.tech). We will review your report in around 1 week or more and respond to you.
We MAY consider paying a bounty reward to you using only Bitcoin (On-chain, Lightning, Cashu) depending on the vulnerability security level. By publishing any public writeup or report before a response from us you will not receive any bounty reward.
After our response to the vulnerability report, you/we can publish a public writeup or report about the vulnerability.
